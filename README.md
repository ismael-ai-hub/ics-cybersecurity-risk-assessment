# ICS Cybersecurity Risk Assessment (Simulation)

## Context
This repository presents a simulated cybersecurity risk assessment for an
Industrial Control System (ICS) environment, inspired by real-world critical
infrastructure such as energy, utilities, and industrial facilities.

The objective is to demonstrate a structured, consulting-oriented approach
to ICS/OT cybersecurity aligned with recognized industry standards.

---

## Objectives
- Understand the differences between IT and OT cybersecurity
- Identify critical assets in an ICS environment
- Analyze cybersecurity risks affecting industrial operations
- Propose security controls without impacting availability or safety
- Apply recognized ICS cybersecurity frameworks

---

## Scope
The simulated environment includes:
- IT business network
- Industrial DMZ (IDMZ)
- OT / ICS network (SCADA, PLCs, HMIs)
- Remote access pathways

This project focuses on **risk analysis and documentation**, not exploitation.

---

## Standards & Frameworks Referenced
- IEC 62443
- NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)
- ISO/IEC 27001 (conceptual alignment)
